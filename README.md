Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the Fun Calculator! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with style and a touch of humor. 😎
Features ✨

    ➕ Addition: Adds two numbers together.

    ➖ Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

    ✖️ Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers.

    ➗ Division: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! 🚨).

How to Use 🚀

    Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).

    Enter the first number when prompted.

    Enter the second number when prompted.

    View the results of all four operations displayed on the screen.

Example Input/Output 📊
plaintext

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0

Important Notes ⚠️

    The calculator assumes valid numerical inputs (no letters or symbols, please!).

    Division by zero will crash the program—handle with care! 😅

Code Overview 💻

The script:

    Takes two numbers as input (converted to float for decimal support).

    Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

    Prints the results in a user-friendly format.

Future Improvements 🔧

    Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).

    Include a check for division by zero to prevent crashes.

    Extend functionality with more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).

Happy calculating! 🎉💻
